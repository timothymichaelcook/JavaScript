//THIS PROGRAM CONVERTS HUMAN AGE TO DOG AGE

//This is your age as a human
const myAge = 22;

//Calculating early years of dog age
let earlyYears = 2;

earlyYears *= 10;
// earlyYears = earlyYears * 10;

//Calculating later years of dog age
let laterYears = myAge - 2;

//Part 2 of calculation
laterYears *= 4;
//laterYears = laterYears * 4;

//Test
//console.log(earlyYears);
//console.log(laterYears);

//Calculate age in dog years
let myAgeInDogYears = earlyYears + laterYears

//String interpolation
const myName = 'Timothy'.toLowerCase();

//Prints to console the string plust ages in human and dog years
console.log(`My name is ${myName}. I am ${myAge} years old in human years which is ${myAgeInDogYears} years old in dog years.`);
